# Azure Multi tenant DNS Resolution

In this article I'm not going to explain in detail how Azure hybrid private DNS zones work [since this is pretty well documented already](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/hybrid/hybrid-dns-infra), so I'm going to assume that you already have a good understanding of this concept. 

## The problem statement
Most organizations leverage a hybrid DNS recursive architecture to be able to resolve private endpoints for Azure PaaS services. There are a few good articles by Microsoft on how to design hybrid DNS with a [forwarder virtual machine in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/networking/azure-dns-private-resolver#use-a-dns-forwarder-vm) or [Azure private DNS resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/networking/azure-dns-private-resolver#use-dns-private-resolver), so I'm not going to rehash these articles in details here today. 

When organizations have multiple Azure Entra ID tenant's, DNS for Azure native services with private endpoints such as Azure Storage becomes a challenge. The reason for this is that a single DNS private zone can only be forwarded to one Entra ID tenant at the time. DNS needs to be common infrastructure in the organization for successful DNS resolution and lookups. When you forward the same DNS zone to two different tenant, with two different private DNS zone record sets, the on-premise DNS forwarder doesn't know to resolve the records in tenant Prod or in tenant Development.

## Possible solutions
Recently I came across a great [Medium article](https://medium.com/sparebank1-digital/multi-tenant-and-hybrid-dns-with-azure-private-dns-6ace8a67b6de) written by Joakim Ellestad that explains this exact issue and how he solved this with Azure Lighthouse and Azure Policy. I shared this with my customer, but they didn't like this for two reasons: 
1. They didn't want to use cross tenant VNET peering between their production tenant and their development tenant. They want to maintain a network isolation boundry between their production and development tenants.
2. They didn't want to adopt Azure Lighthouse for just this problem.

## Another solution
To remove the need for cross tenant VNET peering, I tested out to use of [Azure Private Link Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview). With Azure Private Link Service, we can expose the DNS servers from tenant Production to tenant Development using a private endpoint in tenant Development. Another reason I like this is that we can put the private endpoint on any VNET or subnet in any region in tenant Development.

### Step 1: Cross tenant DNS resolution using Azure Private Link Service 
As you can see in the diagram above, I have two DNS servers in my production tenant, acting as a DNS forwarder to the private DNS zones hosted in that tenant. I put both of these private DNS servers behind a standard Azure Load Balancer to be able to use PLS to my development tenant. Configuration steps:
1. Create two virtual machines in tenant production that act as DNS forwarders. For this scenario you cannot use Azure Private DNS Resolver since Azure Private Link Service requires a standard load balancer.
2. Create a private DNS zone for the Azure PaaS service that you want to resolve (such as privatelink.blob.core.windows.net) and link this private DNS zone to the VNET where your DNS forwarders are hosted.
3. Create an Azure PaaS service (such as an Azure Storage Account) with a private endpoint
4. Create an A-Record for the private endpoint of the Azure PaaS service in the private DNS zone. 
5. Create the private endpoint in the second (development) tenant. Assign the private endpoint to a VNET and subnet in this second (development) tenant.
6. Change the DNS servers on the spoke-vnet to custom and assign the IP of the private endpoint as a custom DNS server.
7. Reboot your virtual machine in the spoke VNET in the development
8. Using NSLookup, you can now resolve the A-record hosted in the Production tenant private DNS zone.

### Step 2: Maintaining A-records accross multiple tenants
To keep the DNS records in sync between the production tenant and the development tenant, I'm using an Azure Function to replicate these a-records. The function lists the a-record from the development tenant and creates a duplicate of this a-record in the private DNS zone in the production tenant. Similarly, if you remove the a-record from the development tenant, the Azure function removes the a-record from the production tenant as well. This means that for private endpoints in the development tenant, you still need to register the DNS records in the private DNS zone (in the development tenant). Using the Azure Portal, you get the option during the creation of the private endpoint on the PaaS service. If you are using Terraform, ARM or another IaC, I highly recommend incorperating this in your automation process. There is also a great [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/private-link-and-dns-integration-at-scale) as part of the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework that describes how you can use a Azure Policy for this. 



Configuration steps for the Azure Function: 

**1. Create the Application Registration** (Development/remote tenant): 
  - Go to Microsoft Entra ID --> App Registration and click on "New Registration". Give the Application Registration a name (for example: func-cross-tenant-dns). Leave the supported account type as is (Single tenant) and click on "Register".
  - On the application registration, under "Manage" go to "Certificates & Secrets". Make sure "Client Secrets" is selected and click on "New Client secret" to create a new client secret. Optionally, give this secret a description and click on add. Copy the secret ID and secret value, we are going to need these later.
  - Go to "API Permissions, click on "Add a permission". Under Mirosoft API's, click on "Microsoft Graph". Select "Application Permissions" and select the "Sites.ReadWrite.All". Click on "Add Permission"
  - In the API permissions screen, click on "Grant admin consent for Default Directory". The final result looks like this:

**2. Assign the application registration permissions on the private DNS zone(s) ** (Development/remote tenant):
